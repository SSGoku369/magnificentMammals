# [Being-in-the-Room Privilege](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/essay-taiwo): Elite Capture and Epistemic Deference 
> From The Philosopher, vol. 108, no. 4 ("What is We?"). 

> “The cunning of trauma politics is that it turns actual people and struggles, whether racial or Indigenous citizenship and belonging, into matters of injury. It defines an entire people mostly on their trauma and not by their aspirations or sheer humanity”. This performance is not for the benefit of Indigenous people, but “for white audiences or institutions of power”. 

Those on the path towards Peace understand that this culture is terribbly traumatized in the now and generationally // all ifdentities. . .

The performance piece stands out, think about how much time these conversations take to have about equality, equity, representation...
I find these sorts of things to be a distraction to the bigger issue >> who is present now? 
+ how will they be affected?
+ we need to learn to design for who is present and always adjust when new energy enters the ecosystem.

> Yet conversations about justice have come to be shaped by people who have ever more specific practical advice about fixing the distribution of attention and conversational power. Deference practices that serve attention-focused campaigns (e.g. we’ve read too many white men, let’s now read some people of colour) can fail on their own highly questionable terms: attention to spokespeople from marginalized groups could, for example, direct attention away from the need to change the social system that marginalizes them.

> Elites from marginalized groups can benefit from this arrangement in ways that are compatible with social progress.

> A constructive approach would focus on the pursuit of specific goals or end results rather than avoiding “complicity” in injustice or adhering to moral principles. It would be concerned primarily with building institutions and cultivating practices of information-gathering rather than helping. It would focus on accountability rather than conformity. It would calibrate itself directly to the task of redistributing social resources and power rather than to intermediary goals cashed out in terms of pedestals or symbolism. It would focus on building and rebuilding rooms, not regulating traffic within and between them – it would be a world-making project: aimed at building and rebuilding actual structures of social connection and movement, rather than mere critique of the ones we already have.
